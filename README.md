## Git vs. GitHub
* Git 
    * Keeps snapshots of code and allows you to edit code in the command line. Used to create/edit files, add files, and commit files, where it's all stored in Github.
* Github
    * Stores the code in a cloud where it is able to be altered later on. Used to track changes done in code and can be used to easily collaborate with files.
    *  Requires Git to properly function and store previously edited/created/altered code.
